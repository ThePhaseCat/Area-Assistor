# Area Assistor

A mod that ports my Java Application, MineCalc, into Minecraft as a client-side mod! 
This is also my first attempt at a Minecraft Mod, and as such, I would not be surprised if there are bugs.

# Requirements
Minecraft `>=1.21.0`

Fabric Loader `>=0.15.11`

Fabric API `>=0.100.1`

owo-lib `0.12.11`

# How to use

To start, open the Area Assistor GUI using the key 0 (Default Bind)

The tabs at the top relate to different services of the mod. Currently, there are three services: Set Values, Area Value/Calculation, and Block Viewing

## Set Values
Select blocks by looking at them, and once all three blocks are selected, the area of the region will be calculated!

## Area Value/Calculation
This will show the value of the area selected using the Set Values service! On top of this, you can view if you're inside the area you've selected. Also, you can select the level of unbreaking your tool currently has (if you're holding a tool) and get an estimation on how many pickaxes you would need to clear the area out!

## Block Viewing
This screen lists all the blocks in the area, and the amount of each block inside the area you've selected!
